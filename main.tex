\D \textbf{My biggest strength is that I listen to the students}. When they are confused or disengaged with the material, that is because I have not communicated well, so I ask questions and go over the topic again. When the same quiz question is answered incorrectly many times, the problem is most likely with the question or my delivery. If students are not coming to me with questions, I have not motivated them enough. If students offer feedback that an assignment was kind of boring, then I need to revise my assignment. I care deeply about the students' success, and the best way to help them is to listen to their issues and adjust to their needs. Students are good at detecting and, usually, reciprocating the instructor's effort. I do my best to be open and inviting to the students, but many remain reluctant to ask for help. I have implemented a few practices to open other channels of feedback and communication:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In CSC 231 -- Introduction to Data Structures, most programming assignments and quizzes are \textbf{automatically graded by testing programs} that I give to the students. The test programs help the students debug their code, and also produce scores so they know where they stand. The test programs help get "smaller" questions out of the way, and thus the questions I get on these assignments are more conceptual or logically challenging.
    \item I pass out index cards and ask students to write down \textit{anonymously} the \textbf{"muddiest point"} -- something they are unclear on from the course in general. I review and sort the cards and start off the next class discussing the most common topics. The students see that other people are confused on a topic, and I get to address a learning gap. Students react very positively to this exercise, and probably no other activity builds rapport with them as strongly in the classroom.
    \item To facilitate the move to online learning, I invite all my students to join a \textbf{Slack workspace} (\href{https://slack.com}{https://slack.com}) with channels for individual classes. The synchronous chatting, instead of email or Zoom, has become the de facto way of communicating in my online classes. We are able to chat, share files, screenshots, and generally collaborate much more easily than via email and without perceived social pressures of a Zoom meeting. Students ping me via Slack when working on assignments at odd hours, and I often respond, which is not something either of us would do via Zoom. In general, the tool has helped me keep more aware of students' progress, while also offering the students a personal synchronous communication avenue to me. In my Fall 2020 course evaluations, many students mentioned Slack as a positive means to "stay connected" to the instructor.

\D \textbf{"Brain Games"} in CSC 231 (Introduction to Data Structures) are in-class, 20-minute, multi-question quizzes that students complete in pairs. Pairs are assigned randomly, and the questions are challenging but performance does not negatively impact their grade. Individuals accumulate points throughout the semester on a leaderboard, and students are awarded extra credit based on their overall score at the end of the semester. The activity yields very lively discussion, peer education, builds camaraderie, and provides me with valuable, no-stakes insight into students' strengths and weaknesses. 

\D \textbf{"The Sorting Sleuth"} in CSC 231 (Introduction to Data Structures) is a program that students use to run experiments to determine the hidden identities of five different sorting algorithms. The students write a report that presents the experimental evidence and justifies their determination of which sorting algorithm is which. The assignment is a break from programming assignments but requires a deep understanding of the subject matter. The assignment can be completed in pairs and requires the students to exercise both their writing and critical reasoning skills in a different way from what is often required in early CSC courses.

\D I use \textbf{externally sponsored term projects} in CSC 315 (Mobile Application Development) wherein I solicit mobile app ideas from the UNCW community (and the students themselves) that students create for the bulk of their course grade. The project sponsor(s) make a presentation to the class and answer questions, and students are allowed to choose from among the sponsored project(s) or their own idea. Outside project ideas implemented by the students include an app to navigate and learn about ecosystems in Carolina Beach State Park from Drs. Taylor and Kubasko from Watson College of Education, an app that matches students with study abroad locations from the Office of International Programs, and a shooting range shot timer using microphone input for Dr. Tagliarini in Computer Science. I find that students are more motivated to work on a project for a third party, or for themselves, than on a concocted-for-the-course project created by the instructor.
